Break down what needs to be done in tasks and write them in a single markdown file in the `plans/` folder. Be as specific and detailed as possible. Each of the tasks will be executed by you in new sessions in which you won't have all the context that you gathered during the current session. Each task should have a status property with default to TODO. Take a systematic approach, use systems thinking and think from first principles. Also apply systems thinking. Think ultra hard.
