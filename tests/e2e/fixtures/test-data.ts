    React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. Before hooks, you had to use class components for state management.
    
    The useState hook is like a Swiss Army knife for state management. It's simple but powerful.
    
    useEffect is your go-to for side effects. Think of it as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount rolled into one.
    
    Custom hooks are where the real magic happens. They're like creating your own tools for specific problems.
