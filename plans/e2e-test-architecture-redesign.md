# E2E Test Architecture Redesign Plan

## Overview
The current e2e test failures stem from fundamental architectural misalignment between Manifest V3 service worker patterns and outdated Manifest V2 test setup. This plan addresses the root causes through systematic redesign.

## PHASE 2 COMPLETION STATUS ✅

**PHASE 2 IS COMPLETE!** All core architecture tasks have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ **Task 2.1**: Service Worker Test Fixture - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Task 2.2**: Chrome API Context Setup - COMPLETED  
- ✅ **Task 2.3**: Build Target Configuration - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Task 2.4**: Update All Test Files - COMPLETED (Additional)
- ✅ **Task 2.5**: Fix Service Worker Logic - COMPLETED (Additional)
- ✅ **Task 2.6**: Extension Page Loading - COMPLETED (Additional)
- ✅ **Task 2.7**: Playwright Configuration - COMPLETED (Additional)

**Key Achievements:**
- Basic extension tests now pass consistently
- Chrome API "undefined" errors eliminated 
- Service worker initialization reliable
- Development build used for CSP compatibility
- All test files updated to new architecture
- Proper timeout and error handling implemented

**Remaining Work:** Phase 3 (Implementation refinement) and Phase 4 (Content validation and optimization)

## Phase 1 Research Impact
Phase 1 research has provided definitive solutions and significantly refined our approach:

**Critical Discovery**: The primary issue is using production build (`dist/chrome-mv3`) instead of development build (`dist/chrome-mv3-dev`). The production build's Content Security Policy blocks localhost connections required for Playwright testing, making the current approach fundamentally incompatible.

**Research-Driven Solutions**:
1. **Build Target**: Must use development build for testing (CSP compatibility)
2. **Service Worker Patterns**: Specific lifecycle management patterns identified from community templates
3. **Browser Configuration**: Optimized browser arguments (7 instead of 26)
4. **API Handling**: Proven Chrome API availability verification patterns
5. **WXT Integration**: Potential to leverage WXT's built-in testing capabilities

The research has transformed this from exploratory work into targeted implementation of proven solutions.

## Root Cause Analysis Summary (Updated with Phase 1 Findings)
- **Core Issue**: Extension uses Manifest V3 (service workers) but tests follow Manifest V2 patterns (background pages)
- **API Failure**: `chrome.storage.sync` undefined due to improper service worker context initialization  
- **Build Mismatch**: Tests load production build (`dist/chrome-mv3`) instead of development build (`dist/chrome-mv3-dev`)
- **CSP Incompatibility**: Production build CSP blocks localhost connections required for Playwright testing
- **Service Worker Lifecycle**: Missing proper service worker activation waiting and state management
- **Error Handling**: No timeout configuration or retry mechanisms for service worker initialization

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION RESEARCH & ANALYSIS

### Task 1.1: Research Modern Playwright Extension Testing Patterns
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Key Findings**:
1. **Service Worker Lifecycle**: Modern patterns require proper service worker activation waiting with state management
2. **WXT Integration**: WXT provides built-in testing capabilities through `WxtVitest` plugin with API polyfills
3. **Chrome API Mocking**: Multiple proven strategies including mem-storage-area and custom implementations
4. **Community Template**: kelseyaubrecht template provides robust service worker handling patterns

**Critical Insights**:
- Service worker activation waiting is essential: `serviceWorker.addEventListener('statechange', ...)`
- Extension fixtures should separate serviceWorker and extensionId concerns
- Modern patterns use 30-second timeouts for service worker initialization
- WXT's `@webext-core/fake-browser` provides in-memory Chrome API implementations

**Document**: ✅ `research/playwright-extension-patterns-2025.md` (comprehensive 500+ line analysis)

**Key Files to Reference**:
- `tests/e2e/fixtures/extension-fixture.ts` (current broken implementation)
- `wxt.config.ts` (WXT configuration)
- `src/entrypoints/background.ts` (service worker implementation)

---

### Task 1.2: Analyze Current Test Infrastructure Gaps
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

**Key Findings**:
1. **Service Worker Issues**: Current fixture lacks service worker activation waiting and proper error handling
2. **Build Target Wrong**: Using production build (`dist/chrome-mv3`) instead of development build (`dist/chrome-mv3-dev`)
3. **Browser Args**: 26 browser arguments may cause conflicts, need optimization
4. **API Patterns**: Inconsistent Chrome API usage across test files without availability verification

**Critical Gaps Identified**:
- No service worker lifecycle management (missing `statechange` event handling)
- No timeout configuration for service worker operations
- Missing Chrome API availability checks before test execution
- No build target validation before loading extension

**Document**: ✅ `analysis/current-test-gaps.md` (comprehensive 452-line analysis with specific architectural recommendations)

**Key Files to Analyze**:
- `tests/e2e/fixtures/extension-fixture.ts`
- All `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts` files
- `dist/chrome-mv3/` vs `dist/chrome-mv3-dev/` directories
- `tests/e2e/fixtures/test-data.ts`

---

### Task 1.3: Validate WXT Build Outputs for Testing
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

**Key Findings**:
1. **Build Size**: Development build is 11x larger (8.0 MB vs 711 kB) but necessary for testing
2. **CSP Critical**: Production CSP blocks localhost connections, development CSP allows them
3. **Permissions**: Development build includes `"tabs"` permission for enhanced testing
4. **Debugging**: Development build has readable code vs minified production code

**Critical Recommendation**: **MUST use development build (`dist/chrome-mv3-dev`) for testing**

**CSP Analysis**:
- **Production**: `script-src 'self'` (blocks localhost)
- **Development**: `script-src 'self' http://localhost:3000` (allows localhost)
- **Testing Impact**: Production CSP makes Playwright testing impossible

**Document**: ✅ `analysis/wxt-build-comparison.md` (comprehensive 586-line analysis with definitive recommendation)

**Dependencies**: 
- Requires Task 1.1 research findings

    // Verify build exists
    if (!fs.existsSync(path.join(pathToExtension, 'manifest.json'))) {
      throw new Error(`Build target not found: ${pathToExtension}`);
    }
    // Optimized browser args (7 instead of 26)
    const context = await chromium.launchPersistentContext(userDataDir, {
      args: [
        `--disable-extensions-except=${pathToExtension}`,
        `--load-extension=${pathToExtension}`,
        '--disable-component-extensions-with-background-pages',
        '--disable-web-security', '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
        '--no-sandbox', '--enable-automation'
      ],
    });
    await use(context);
  },
  
  serviceWorker: async ({ context }, use) => {
    let [serviceWorker] = context.serviceWorkers();
    if (!serviceWorker) {
      serviceWorker = await context.waitForEvent('serviceworker', { timeout: 30000 });
    }
    // Research-proven activation waiting pattern
    await serviceWorker.evaluate(() => new Promise((resolve) => {
      if (serviceWorker.state === 'activated') {
        resolve();
      } else {
        serviceWorker.addEventListener('statechange', () => {
          if (serviceWorker.state === 'activated') resolve();
        });
      }
    }));
    await use(serviceWorker);
  },
  
  extensionId: async ({ serviceWorker }, use) => {
    const extensionId = serviceWorker.url().split('/')[2];
    if (!extensionId || extensionId.length !== 32) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid extension ID: ${extensionId}`);
    }
    await use(extensionId);
  },
});
```

2. **Storage API Utilities**: Create test data seeding and verification functions
3. **Error Handling**: Add proper error messages for API failures
4. **WXT Integration**: Consider leveraging WXT's `@webext-core/fake-browser` for comprehensive mocking

**Technical Implementation** (from research):
```typescript
// tests/e2e/fixtures/chrome-api-setup.ts
export const setupChromeAPIs = async (serviceWorker: Worker) => {
  // Verify Chrome APIs are available
  await serviceWorker.evaluate(() => {
    if (!chrome || !chrome.storage || !chrome.storage.sync) {
      throw new Error('Chrome APIs not available in service worker context');
    }
  });
};

export const seedTestData = async (serviceWorker: Worker, testData: any) => {
  await serviceWorker.evaluate((data) => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      chrome.storage.sync.set(data, () => resolve(undefined));
    });
  }, testData);
};

export const verifyStorageState = async (serviceWorker: Worker, expectedKeys: string[]) => {
  return await serviceWorker.evaluate((keys) => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      chrome.storage.sync.get(keys, (result) => resolve(result));
    });
  }, expectedKeys);
};

// Integration with extension fixture
chromeApiReady: async ({ serviceWorker }, use) => {
  await setupChromeAPIs(serviceWorker);
  await use(true);
},
```

**WXT Alternative** (from research):
```typescript
// Consider using WXT's built-in testing capabilities
// vitest.config.ts
import { WxtVitest } from 'wxt/testing';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [WxtVitest()], // Provides @webext-core/fake-browser
});
```

**Validation Criteria**:

1. **Update extension fixture path**: Change from `./dist/chrome-mv3` to `./dist/chrome-mv3-dev`
2. **Add build verification**: Ensure manifest.json exists before testing
3. **Update test scripts**: Ensure `pnpm build` creates development build before testing
4. **Document rationale**: Update comments explaining why development build is required

**Technical Implementation** (from research):
```typescript
// tests/e2e/fixtures/extension-fixture.ts
const pathToExtension = path.resolve('./dist/chrome-mv3-dev'); // CRITICAL: Use dev build

// Add build verification
if (!fs.existsSync(path.join(pathToExtension, 'manifest.json'))) {
  throw new Error(`Build target not found: ${pathToExtension}`);
}
```

**Package.json Scripts**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:e2e": "pnpm build && playwright test",
    "test:e2e:dev": "pnpm build && playwright test --headed",
